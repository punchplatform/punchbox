# Punchplatform Integration

This folder provides easy tools to deploy and to validate a complete Punchplatform with different configurations 

**Warning**

  - This version is a Beta
  - Alpha version named 6.1 will be released mid-June
  - Validation section use standalone and punchbox resources, it will be fixed soon to be more flexible
  - Requires hardcode configuration : SLACK_WEBHOOK environment variable set with specific slack webhook URL

## Punchplatform deployment

Assumming you also have a punchplatform deployer and your associated configuration somewhere
type in the following command: (remove the --start-vagrant to no start the vagrant boxes)

```sh
punchbox --config configurations/complete_punch_16G.json \
        --generate-vagrantfile \
        --punch-conf <path_to_your_punchplatform_config_folder> \
        --deployer <path_to_your_punchplatform_deployer_zip> \
        --start-vagrant
```

This will unzip the punch deployer archive, as well as the sample standalone channels so that you will have a complete
sample application deployed on your punch.

Once that done go on and generate the punch deployment files. You dop that using the `punchplatform-deployer.sh`
tool that is now available to you. 

```sh
source $PUNCHBOX_DIR/activate.sh
punchplatform-deployer.sh --generate-platform-config \
    --templates-dir $PUNCHBOX_DIR/punch/platform_template/ \
    --model $PUNCHBOX_DIR/punch/build/model.json
punchplatform-deployer.sh -gi
```

Last you can effectively deploy the punch. Note that you can use tags to install only
a part of it:
Note that  a successful configuration generation you can deploy a specific component for example:

```sh
# install everything 
punchplatform-deployer.sh deploy -u vagrant
# install only install zookeeper
punchplatform-deployer.sh deploy -u vagrant --tags zookeeper
# install zookeeper plus operator
punchplatform-deployer.sh deploy -u vagrant --tags zookeeper,operator
```

### Daily usage 

If you want to reset your environnement : 

```sh
make clean
```

If you made a mistake in your user config file for example, you might want to regenerate the configuration file without 
dealing another time with vagrant boxes. For that use `punchbox` without vagrant options: 

```sh
make install
source activate.sh
punchbox --deployer ../pp-punch/pp-packaging/punchplatform-deployer/target/punchplatform-deployer-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip --config configurations/32-full.json --punch-conf ../pp-punch/pp-packaging/punchplatform-standalone/punchplatform-standalone-linux/target/tmp/punchplatform-standalone-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf
source activate 
punchplatform-deployer.sh --generate-platform-config --templates-dir punch/platform_template/ --model punch/build/model.json
punchplatform-deployer.sh -gi
```

If you want to only deal with vagrant boxes, you must use vagrant options : 

```sh
punchbox --config configurations/32-full.json --generate-vagrantfile --start-vagrant  
```

**Note** : For each update on config or templates you must relaunch all these commands, you can only play with `punchbox` options to be more or less verbose

## Options

| Option | Details | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --help | Usage summary. | --help |
| --deployer | Path to the deployer's zip archive. This option is used to generate the configuration model with components versions and user properties. | --deployer /Downloads/punchplatform-deployer-6.0.0.zip |
| --punch-conf | Path to a Punchpatform's configuration folder to import resources inside the shared folder. These resources will further be placed inside the configuration folder in operator nodes. | --punch-conf /home/user/punchplatform-standalone-linux-6.0.0/pp-conf |
| --config | Path to the user configuration. | --config configurations/complete_punch_32G.json |
| --destroy-vagrant | Destroy the machines mounted from the Vagrantfile inside the current `vagrant` folder. | --destroy-vagrant |
| --generate-vagrantfile | Generate a Vagrantfile inside the `vagrant` folder, from `targets.info` and `targets.meta` sections in user configuration. | --generate-vagrantfile |
| --start-vagrant | Mount VMs right after the Vagrantfile generation. Same as `vagrant up` in vagrant folder. | --start-vagrant |
| --generate-inventory | Generate an inventory file to mount VMs without vagrant. | --generate-inventory |
| --generate-playbook | Generate an ansible playbook to mount VMs without vagrant. | --generate-playbook |
| --os | OS name to mount on VMs during the vagrant phase. Used to overwrite the os name inside the user's configuration. | --os centos/7 |
| --interface | Interface name used by the deployed punchplatform components. This value should match the production interface on the mounted VMs. This option does not overwrite or change the interfaces names for vagrant. | --interface eth1 |
| --security | Inject security configurations inside any user configuration to enable Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana servers security | --security |

## Secured deployment

To deploy the Punchplatform alongside security measures, use the `--security` option with a complete configuration file :

```shell
make install
source activate.sh
punchbox --config configurations/complete_punch_32G.json \
        --security
        --punch-conf <path_to_your_punchplatform_config_folder> \
        --deployer <path_to_your_punchplatform_deployer_zip> \
        --generate-vagrantfile \
        --start-vagrant

source activate 
punchplatform-deployer.sh --generate-platform-config --templates-dir punch/platform_template/ --model punch/build/model.json
punchplatform-deployer.sh -gi
```

A secured deployment enable :

* Authentication to the Elasticsearch cluster
* Authentication to the Kibana servers

There is no need for further actions, the deployment and the validation steps remain unchanged for the user.

## Punchplatform validation  

Once you have deployed your Punchplatform, you may be wondering how to check your platform health

Refer to the [validation](./validation/README.md) guide.
