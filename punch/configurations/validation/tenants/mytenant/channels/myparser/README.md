# Parser Package

This punchline expects you install the sample parser package. 
Refer to the standalone 'Parser' getting started. 

If you try to start it without installing that sample parser, it will fail
as expected. 

## logs/log or logs/data

Pay attention to this. The punchline here generates a 
'[logs][data]' stream, as expected by the sample parser.punch. 

This differs from most punch parsing punchline that convert
that [logs][data]  into an [logs][log] stream in an upfront punchlet.
